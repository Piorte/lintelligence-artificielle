      <p>AI is particularly present in voice assistants, just like Google, Siri, Bixby, Alexa or Celia, these AIs
        allow
        us to help us in our daily lives, such as turning off the lights at 8 p.m. if we have a connected house, or
        ask
        him for the weather by simply calling him by his name by saying "hey google" or "dit siri" for the best known,

      <h2 id="3">3. AI in healthcare :</h2>
      <img src="Files/3-img-ia-watson-IBM.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>In Great Britain researchers have studied the ability of AI in predicting a heart attack in a patient. That
        is
        to say, she is able to accumulate and consolidate a large amount of medical information. So she's much more
        efficient than humans at making diagnoses.
        The benefits: Doctors will be able to focus on their at-risk patients, while others will avoid unnecessary
        treatment.<br>
        This AI system was named Watson and developed by an IBM. Thanks to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/fr-fr/watson"
          target="_blank" class="a"><u>Watson</u></a> because he not only confirmed treatments prescribed by
        oncologists, but he also found 30% more treatment options that doctors had not identified.<br><br>
        <img src="Files/3-gif-ia-xenobots.gif" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
        There are also the <a

          target="_blank" class="a"><u>Xenobots</u></a> : they are living robots born from the combination of AI and
        biology. Made from a skin and heart stem cell of one of the xenopus genus. For the moment, we have found them
        useful to program them to treat diseased organs.

      <h2 id="4">4. AI in art :</h2>
      <img src="Files/4-img-ia-logo-midjourney.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/" target="_blank" class="a"><u>"Midjourney"</u></a> is currently the
        most powerful ai in the artistic universe, this ai found on discord allows to transform words (called
        "prompts")
        into works of art, we can ask it for any artistic style and no any resolution. Recently released v5 can make
        such realistic works that we can't tell the difference with a photo.</p><br>

      <p><a href="https://makeavideo.studio/" target="_blank" class="a"><u>"Make a video"</u></a> is an ai developed
        by
        google and meta allowing to make videos by following the same process as Midjourney (prompts). Just ask him:
        "A
        teddy bear making a portrait" to generate an excerpt from the video above. But make-a-video was suspended
        because we could create too many deep-fakes (fake videos) which I will explain in <a href="#14" class="a"><u>The

      <h2 id="7">7. Chatgpt</h2>
      <img src="Files/7-img-ia-logo-stylisee-chatGPT-circuit.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformerest) is a prototype conversational agent using artificial
        intelligence, developed by OpenAI and specialized in dialogue.<br>ChatGPT is able to generate answers to
        questions, to complete sentences, translate texts, code in any programming language, write articles and hold
        conversations with humans. <br> To visualize the power of this ia chat GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and
        chat
        GPT-4 has 100 trillion (ie 100,000 billion) parameters, which corresponds to the number of parameters of a
        human
        brain. <br>This AI has the capabilities to claim to be the most powerful artificial intelligence to date !</p>

      <h2 id="8">8. Microsoft bing</h2>
      <p>Although ChatGPT is a powerful AI model, bing recently released its AI in collaboration with the openAI
        company. Its name : "the new bing", nothing impressive for the moment, but it has as many advantages as
        disadvantages than chatGPT and competes with the google chrome browser !
      </p><br><br>
      <img src="Files/8-img-ia-page-dacceuil-nouveau-bing-presentation.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Advantages over chatGPT:</p>
      <ul type="disc" class="liste">
        <li>
          <m>Co-pilot at your fingertips</m>
        </li>

      <p>Disadvantages compared to chatGPT :</p>
      <ul type="disc" class="list">
        <li>
          <m>Based only on sources</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Lower text output quality and length than chatGPT</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>A few more inaccuracies</m>
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>As you have understood, bing will be more dedicated to research than chatGPT, some Internet users call it
        "the
        free chatGPT 4" because as it is connected to the web it will never miss news when you had to pay for it
        access
        the latest information with chatGPT 4.
        To conclude, these 2 models of artificial intelligence are very different and it will be necessary to choose
        according to the necessary need, bing for research and chatGPT for a more elaborate answer. </p><br>

      <h2 id="9">9. Google innovations 2023-2024</h2>
      <img src="Files/9-img-ia-page-dacceuil-google-event-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>The <a href="https://io.google/2023/" target="_blank" class="a"><u>Google I/O</u></a>, this annual event
        where
        Google unveils its latest magic tricks. This year, the May 10 conference was no exception to the rule, with
        artificial intelligence in the spotlight. Here are the details of the 11 most impressive demos of this 2023
        edition.
      </p><br>

      <h4 id="a">1. The fastest photoshop ever thanks to the all new google photos ai :</h4>
      <br> <img src="Files/9-gif-ia-google-magic-editor-ex1-IO.gif" alt="ia" width="800"><br> <img
        src="Files/9-gif-ia-google-magic-editor-ex2-details-IO.gif" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Google Photos' new editing tool, Magic Editor, lets you do major editing like enhancing the sky, erasing
        people
        in the background, and even moving an object by recreating a part that was cut out by framing the photo as we
        can see in photo number 2, where the child's bench and balloons have been recreated!</p><br>

      <h4 id="b">2. The detector of images created in generative AI :</h4>
      <p>Faced with the proliferation of images modified by AI or generated by tools like Midjourney or Stable
        Diffusion, Google offers a solution: the Â«â€‰About this imageâ€‰Â» function.<br> <br><img
          src="Files/9-img-ia-google-about-this-image-source-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br> Thus, Google will be
        able
        to identify the origin of the images, as it does with fake news. It is able to trace the origin of a photo,
        not
        just by looking for clues in the photo, but in the original image in its database.</p><br>

      <h4 id="c">3. Google Maps and its Â« immersive view for routes Â» :</h4>
      <p>Get ready to see your route planning from a whole new perspective. The new feature of Google Maps compiles
        all

      <h4 id="d">4. MusicLM, the AI tool that turns text into music :</h4>
      <p>Tired of ready-made playlists? While google had created the dedicated magenta ai for music, google released
        an
        even more powerful ai for music, its name : <a
          href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/?ref=futuretools.io" target="_blank"
          class="a"><u>"MusicLM"</u></a>.</p> <br><br><img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-musicLM-presentation-wait-list-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Simply type in "soulful jazz for a dinner party" and have the tool create several versions of the song for
        you.
        Here is an excerpt of music produced by musicLM :<br><br><audio controls controlslist="nodownload">
          <source src="Files/9-relaxing-jazz-create-by-musicLM.mp3" type="audio/mp3">"Your browser does not support
          the
          audio element."
        </audio><br><br> This music generator is entering a public test phase, you can register on the <a
          href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/musiclm-google-ai-test-kitchen/" target="_blank" class="a"><u>waiting

      <h4 id="e">5. Universal Translator, dubbing</h4>
      <p>Presented at the Google I/O conference, the Universal Translator aims to transpose videos from one language
        to
        another, while preserving the original intonation and atmosphere. It is actually a lip-synced translator.</p>
      <br><br> <img src="Files/9-img-ia-google-presentation-universal-translator-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>This means that this tool is not limited to converting audio from one language to another, it also reproduces
        the speaker's voice, intonation and facial expressions. You understood correctly: the translated video adjusts
        the speaker's labial movements to match the expressions specific to the target language.</p><br>

      <h4 id="f">6. Sidekick, the personal assistant for Google Docs :</h4>
      <p>Google's new Sidekick panel, introduced at this conference, integrates into a side panel of Google Docs. It
        continuously reads and processes your entire document as you write, offering contextual suggestions that refer
        specifically to what you've written.</p><br><br> <img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-bard-sidekick-doc-suggest-generating-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>For example, if you're writing a children's story, Sidekick can suggest what might happen next in the story.
        The tool can also generate images based on the content of the document, helping to illustrate the story as it
        is
        written. Google has also demonstrated the ability to summarize written conversations, offer speaker notes, and
        more. All of these features are part of Google's newly rebranded Duet AI suite. It's a comparable solution to
        what Microsoft showed off with its AI-powered Copilot features.</p><br>

      <h4 id="g">7. Tailwind, the AI-powered notebook tool :</h4>
      <p>If you've always dreamed of a personal assistant that automatically organizes and summarizes your notes, the
        <a href="https://thoughtful.sandbox.google.com/about" target="_blank" class="a"><u>Project Tailwind</u></a> is
        made for you
      </p><br><br> <img src="Files/9-img-ia-google-tailwind-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Select files from Google Drive and the tool creates an AI model, as well as a custom interface for browsing
        notes and documents.</p><br>

      <h4 id="h">8. Project Starline, the 3D teleconference :</h4>
      <p>No more Zoom meetings where it is difficult to distinguish the faces of his colleagues. With the latest
        Project
        Starline prototype, Google offers a 3D teleconferencing video booth. </p><br><br> <img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-project-starline-3D-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Notable improvements include less hardware, such as fewer cameras and more reliance on AI and machine
        learning
        to generate three-dimensional images.</p><br>

      <h4 id="i">9. Google can write your texts using AI :</h4>
      <p>The Magic Compose feature allows you to rewrite texts in different styles, more positive, more professional
        or
        even in the manner of Shakespeare for nostalgic literary people. </p><br><br> <img
        src="Files/9-gif-ia-google-magic-compose-message-IO.gif" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>This functionality will be integrated into Google Messages. You will start by writing your message in the
        usual
        way. Then you will choose the tone you want to give to the message and Magic Compose will adapt the text
        accordingly.</p><br> <img src="Files/9-img-ia-google-magic-compose-gmail-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Regarding Gmail, Google has unveiled a frankly impressive feature. Called Help Me Write, it's as simple as
        the
        name suggests: by clicking a button at the bottom of the email window, you can ask Gmail to formulate a
        response
        for you.</p>

      <h4 id="j">10. Presentation of paLM 2 :</h4>
      <p><a href="https://ai.google/discover/palm2/" target="_blank" class="a"><u>paLM 2</u></a> is an artificial
        intelligence operating under <a href="#10" class="a"><u>google bard</u></a> (which will be explored in depth
        on
        the next topic)
        dedicated to programming. This ai excels in all programming languages such as python, java, c++, javascript,
        and
        much more... paLM also has the ability to transform python code into c++ code, and this is not everything
        besides being able this AI can also solve any math problem ! </p><br><br> <img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-presentation-logo-paLM2-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>paLM 2 has several models that provide excellent core capabilities in a wide range of sizes. Google named
        them:
        "Gecko" - "Otter" - "Bison" - "Unicorn".</p><br> <img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-presentation-models-paLM2-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>Gecko is so light it can run on any mobile device and is fast enough for large interactive apps on a
        terminal,
        even offline. paLM 2 models are more powerful in logic and reasoning thanks to extensive training in
        scientific,
        mathematical fields and also in more than 100 languages to be able to help developers around the world !</p>
      <br>
      <img src="Files/9-img-ia-google-presentation-code-lang-with-paLM2-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>

      <h4 id="k">11. Presentation of a. sec-paLM and b. med-paLM 2 :</h4>
      <p> a. Sec-paLM: In addition to paLM 2, google has developed sec-paLM, a dedicated AI for security. Sec-paLM is
        actually a version of paLM 2 fine-tuned for security-related use cases. It therefore uses AI to better detect
        malicious scripts and can help security experts understand and resolve threats.</p><br> <img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-presentation-model-sec-paLM-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br><br>
      <p>b. med-paLM 2: So there is also med-paLM 2, an AI this time dedicated to the field of medical knowledge.
        med-paLM 2 makes it possible to divide by 9 the inexact reasonings compared to the model, it approaches thus
        the
        performances of the clinical experts who answered the same questions !</p><br> <img
        src="Files/9-img-ia-google-presentation-model-med-paLM2-IO.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>In fact, med-paLM 2 was the first language model to achieve "expert level" on medial aptitude exam questions
        and to be state-of-the-art. Google is still working today on adding features to med-paLM 2 so that it can
        synthesize information from medical imaging. Imagine an AI collaborator who helps radiologists, interprets
        images and communicates results.</p>

      <h2 id="10">10. Google bard</h2>
      <p>After chatGPT and Bing it's <a href="https://bard.google.com/?hl=en" target="_blank" class="a"><u>Google
            Bard</u></a>
        which is launching into artificial intelligence to get ahead of OpenAI and Microsoft, which had released their
        AI model long before Google. But then what does this artificial intelligence have more than the other two ai.
      </p><br>
      <img src="Files/10-img-ia-google-bard-logo.png" alt="ia" width="500"><br>
      <p>
        â–¶ An AI that can read and understand images:<br>
        Indeed Bard is at the forefront of technology, he can read any images while the others
        models still had a lot of imprecision.<br><br>
        â–¶ An AI like Bing, available everywhere:<br>
        Just like Bing, google Bard is available to any google search to be able to give
        Additional Information. Bard may also be available on google docs, slides, sheets, gmail and in
        the field of programming as seen previously in google innovations.<br><br>
        â–¶ An AI that can display images:<br>
        Both ChatGPT and Bing lacked one last thing, google figured out where the problem was: the
        chatbot Bard sees the arrival of a new way of displaying information, closer to research than we
        knows. Now, in his answers, Bard can integrate images from Google Images to clarify the
        information and make users more eager to use the artificial intelligence model of
        google.<br><br>
        â–¶ An AI that can generate images:<br>
        OpenAi had the possibility to generate images thanks to Dall-E, the same for Bing, but for Bard it is a
        brand new generative image AI: Adobe Firefly, from the professional company "Adobe", but what more
        apart from prestige compared to others? Well instead of changing from one application to another, the
        image generation will be directly integrated into the Bard chatbot.</p><br>

      <img src="Files/10-img-ia-google-bard-access.png" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>In short, Google Bard is surely the most advanced AI model. Moreover it is now available
        today 7/13/23 after a long wait from all over the world, we can test it right away at
        the address <a href="bard.google.com" target="_blank" class="a">bard.google.com</a>. Despite this
        output, there are still some features that are not available in France such as exposing an image
        with a prompt to make it generate a response based on the illustration it was given. Nevertheless he is
        still possible to have access to it by modifying the parameters of the google account to put it in English
        because
        these functions will only be available in English.

      <h2 id="11">11. Paragraphica :</h2>
      <p>Paragraphica is an artistic project without camera or lens. This machine uses the design of the appendages
        that
        allow star moles to sense their environment. Paragraphica sees nothing, the object "imagines" the exterior
        from
        a prompt.
        <br>Here is a 3D model of the paragraphica creator's site that you can manipulate :<br><br>
        <iframe src="https://camera.sandbox.noodl.app/" title="Paragraphica" width="800" height="500"></iframe><br>
        <br>And here is a video extract on the presentation of paragraphica :<br><br>

        This project therefore aims to collect different data, such as location, time, weather, etc... then using
        different AI, it will be able to generate a high quality photograph roughly resembling the place. It is also
        possible to choose the angle of view, close locations, framing and much more. In addition, when this machine
        analyzes the data it offers a prompt like a text with gaps that can be modified to give an atmosphere, a
        weather
        forecast, or even to produce a completely modified image of what we see. This machine therefore creates an
        alternate world that will partly correspond to reality but without any trace of it. A fake world that
        Paragraphica imagines for you to create fake memories.
      </p><br>
      Here are some examples of accomplishments :<br><br>
      <img src="Files/11-img-ia-paragraphica-exemples-creation.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>

      <p>Benefits :</p>
      <ul type="disc" class="liste">
        <li>
          <m>Create a quality photo</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Create an atmosphere and an alternative world</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Reveal artistic thoughts to generate an image</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Avoid putting too much money in goals</m>
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Disadvantages:</p>
      <ul type="disc" class="liste">
        <li>
          <m>No ability to capture real memories such as group photos or moments
            individuals</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Difficulty indoors</m>

        <li>
          <m>Lack of precision about reality</m>
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Paragraphica is therefore a complex device that can be used for many purposes such as images for video games
        or
        films, so for the moment it remains an object dedicated to fictitious appearance.</p><br>

      <img src="Files/13-img-ia-ai-can-think-or-learn-binary-code.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>AI involves 3 types of learning:</p>
      <ul type="disc" class="liste">
        <li>
          <m>supervised learning</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>unsupervised learning</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>reinforcement learning</m>
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Supervised learning is a computer program that confronts AI with a set of data
        which have already been used by his training. Thanks to this, the AI will be able to rely on its knowledge to
        the color of the apple it will be green or red and for that of the orange it will be orange.</p><br>
      <p>Unsupervised learning is confronting the AI with objects that are not in its database.
        So the AI will have to learn on its own, for example how many species are there? She never learned
        but she knows that there are different colors like the hen and the rabbit, so she can conclude
        that there are 2 different species by their color.</p><br>
      <p>Reinforcement learning : <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago"
          target="_blank" class="a"><u>AlphaGO</u></a>, Google's AI uses this learning technique. This one implied
        tell the program what you want it to do, and then let it do its thing. To the extent that
        as he progresses towards the desired goal, he is better rated and his positive actions are thus reinforced. Eg
        in chess, the AI learns its moves that cause it to lose and will not use them in the future, but on the other
        hand the winning moves she retains and uses in the future.</p><br><br>

      <img src="Files/14-gif-ia-Google-Teachable-Machine.gif" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>An AI available to all is capable of representing this type of learning: Google Teachable
        Machine. Indeed, this AI model uses deep learning to create classification models based on
        neural networks. It is a more advanced form of machine learning and more suited to certain tasks.
        This AI is therefore capable of naming things from several elements that we provide to it (images,
        videos, sounds), we can also connect it to smart devices such as televisions or
        lamps. Imagine that after having trained it, you could turn on the light in the living room with a snap of
        your fingers! But she is capable of much more than that, after several sound recognition training,
        we gave birth to an AI of the same model as that of teachable machine capable of recognizing the noise that
        does every key on the keyboard. With an error rate of only 5% this AI could in the future guess your
        Passwords....</p>

      <p>This is not science fiction. A robot woman has just been appointed head of a big company
        Chinese. One of the Chinese video game leaders, NetDragon Websoft.<br>

      <p>And then there was a table created by the ai midjourney which has been controversial lately by winning a
        contest
        of art in the "digital art" category in the United States.<br>
        A netizen wrote: <br><i>"The death of the profession of artist is unfolding right now before our eyes. If the
          creative professions are not machine-proof, so even high-skill professions are at risk of
          become obsolete. What will we be left with then?"</i></p><br>

      <img src="Files/16-img-ia-be-or-not-be.jpg" alt="ia" width="800"><br>
      <p>AI has been able to make great advances in many fields such as medicine, art, etc...<br> But
        in the wrong hands it can be used for criminal purposes or disinformation,<br> threats are
        serious:
      <p>
      <ul type="disc" class="liste">
        <li>
          <m>Impersonation: impersonating someone by making them say or do something that they
            has ever done (as with make-a-video), and these fake videos will be virtually undetectable.
            In the United States, a mother received a call from a man who claimed to be holding her daughter and asked
            for a
            ransom. The hesitant mother notified the police, a little later it is discovered when the investigation
            has
            been solved
            that the man had used an AI to clone the daughter's voice and trick the mother into thinking he had her
            daughter hostage and that in truth her daughter is doing very well. The story is terrifying and shows how
            AI can be used for criminal activities. <a

        My name is GaÃ«tan GIL and I am passionate about programming, the universe, new technologies and
        artificial intelligence that I had the honor of presenting to you on this web page. When I designed my
        site I gathered my knowledge on this subject and research on the most recent innovations like
        the innovations of google which were exposed in May 2023. When I will be aware of the novelties comprising
        this
        subject my site will be updated so that a new part will be published. A new AI model to me
